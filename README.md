# Chat Agent Playground

This project contains two attempts at creating an agent with LangChain. You can find a simple command line application in file 
[agent_playground.py](agent_playground.py).

You can run this agent on the console by typing:

```bash
python.exe ./agent_playground.py 
```

## Pre-requisites

Please install a conda environment by running the following commands so that you can run this simple agent.

```
conda activate langchain_streamlit
pip install langchain
pip install prompt_toolkit
pip install wikipedia
pip install arxiv
pip install python-dotenv
pip install streamlit
pip install openai
pip install duckduckgo-search
```

And make sure you have a .env file in the root folder with the OPENAI_API_KEY system variable, like e.g:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>
```
